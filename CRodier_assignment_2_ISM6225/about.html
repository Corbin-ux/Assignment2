        <h2>Corbin Rodier</h2>
        <p>
           I am a grad student at USF persuing a masters in Business Analytics and AI. I have an interest in Electric Cars, and I will share with you a little about my experience making this website.
           I used vsc to code in HTML for the structure of the website and used css to style the website. I utilized W3schools online information about coding in HTML and CSS, as well as 
           resources provided by Prof. Clinton. Further, ChatGPT was a powerful tool to help tweak my code as well as find new ways of completing the website.
           
           This was an amazing experience and I am already looking forward to making my next webpage.

         <p> I am excited to work on another project with the goal of explaining to patients their treatment options (cancer to start.)
        I hope to improve upon certain areas such as using more pictures, drawing from great free resources such as freeimages.com, etc. I hope to improve upon my colorscheme to make it more friendly to night time users.
    Further, I would like to improve upon the ideas here, I would have used ben franklin dollar bill picture as a back ground to reference ben franklin discovering electricity, and then use electricity a back ground as well. Time constraints led to envisioning what I would have done with more time, but my style of work for this project was spent most of the time thinking about the subject and then improving upon it or revising it in my head early to save myself the time and effort of formating images and searching etc.
I originally wanted to use my chemistry back ground to describe that a battery is a half cell, but I felt that this was highly relevant but couldn't figure out how to encorporate it without being too nerdy about it, as the images I found for a cell reaction were not high quality but low quality cartoons.
I would also like to make the analytics page reasonable for this sort of project. I would save the form and include that in a tally and then display the top three positions without formatting the array. 
This project was completed in the final 36 hours. Some of my time thinking about this was slowed by the multiple different windows that I had open, word docs and many things for another class in machine learning cluttering my ram (desk so to speak.)
  </p>

  <p>All in all this was a fun project and ready to take on the next thing</p>
