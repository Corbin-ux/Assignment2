        <h2>The Discovery of Electricity</h2>
        <p>
            Benjamin Franklin is famously remembered for his experiments with electricity, including flying a kite in a thunderstorm.
            While the myth suggests he captured lightning in a bottle, the real story is that Franklin's experiments demonstrated
            the connection between lightning and electrical charges. His work laid the foundation for our understanding of electricity,
            which powers our modern lives and innovations, including electric cars.

        <h2>The Birth of the Automobile</h2>
        <p>
            The automobile revolution began in the late 19th century, with innovators like Karl Benz developing the first gasoline-powered
            car in 1885. Over time, the auto industry grew, transforming transportation and enabling personal mobility. 
            Interestingly, early cars included electric models, but they were soon overshadowed by their gasoline counterparts due to limited battery technology.
